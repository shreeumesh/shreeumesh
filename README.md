## 👨‍💻 About Me

Software Developer with hands-on experience in healthcare data systems.  
Strong foundation in SQL, data models, reporting workflows, and clinical analytics support.

Currently transitioning into **Data Engineering**, focusing on building scalable data pipelines, cloud data warehousing solutions, and distributed processing systems.

I aim to design reliable, production-grade data systems that transform raw data into meaningful insights.
